            <p class="project_text">I designed a typeface for my Typography 3 class at Northeastern University. We were tasked with designing a typeface that could be used for body copy at 7pt. We were allowed a lot of freedom in what we wanted our typeface to be.</p>

            <p class="project_text">As the typeface came together, from capitals, to lowercase, to punctuation, to metrics, its personality formed. It started reminding me of something you'd see in a childhood scary story. I named it after my favorite character from my favorite childhood books: Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events.</p>
