            <p class="project_text">Table decal designed for Broadway Bites food market in Greeley Square, NYC. Designed to add a fun, delightful experience to the market's existing branding and signage. Under the existing branding Tiny Rebels had already developed, I was given sketches to create a decal for the tables at the market. I arranged various icons into a "placemat." In arranging everything, I thought of this as an interactive experience. I envisioned someone eating at this table, putting their food on the plate icon, and their drink on a drink icon.</p>
            <p class="project_text"> I made sure there was a drink next to each plate. I came across this Instagram post while searching the hashtag for the market, #bwaybites. It was a treat finding a stranger using the table exactly in the way it was intended. (Excuse their language!)</p>
